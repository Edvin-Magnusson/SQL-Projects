# Covid-19 Project 

In this project, I have used two tables, one containing information on deaths associated with covid and one with data on covid vaccinations.
Two new SQL concepts I have used for this project are JOIN and common table expression (CTE). 
- This project, was inspired by Alex Freberg's project that I studied while learning new SQL concepts. However, I added some new queries and concepts.
